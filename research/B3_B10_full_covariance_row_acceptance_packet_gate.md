## Acceptance Packet

- Submission path: `results/B3_B10_full_covariance_row_acceptance_packet_submissions/B3-R1-full-covariance-row-acceptance-packet.json`

Required evidence files:

- accepted_row_replay_validation_manifest
- priority_reopen_packet
- accepted_provenance_manifest
- accepted_denominator_replay_manifest
- row_scope_manifest
- full_covariance_row_table
- compiled_state_replay_or_sampler_trace
- pauli_grouping_covariance_replay
- derivative_estimator_replay
- selected_ci_fci_denominator_replay
- optimizer_loop_cost_ledger
- same_access_decision_report
- b10_access_boundary_note
- row_acceptance_ledger
- negative_boundary_nonpromotion_note
- b3_reopen_boundary_note
- claim_boundary_note

Acceptance predicates:

- acceptance_packet_id equals B3-R1-full-covariance-row-acceptance-packet
- provenance, denominator replay, row replay-validation, priority packet, and downstream packet IDs and hashes match the source gates
- row scope, full covariance row table, compiled-state replay, Pauli grouping covariance replay, derivative estimator replay, selected-CI/FCI denominator replay, optimizer-loop cost ledger, same-access decision, and B10 access boundary are hash-bound
- accepted_full_covariance_row_count and denominator_win_count are positive only after source evidence exists
- optimizer_loop_total_shots_lower_bound preserves the locked 475,043,013,690,000-shot lower-bound pressure
- B3 reopen boundary keeps multi-parameter converged chemistry and reaction-dynamics solution claims false
- B10 access boundary keeps positive same-access route and BQP separation credit false
- claim_boundary forbids B3 reopen, reaction-dynamics solution, quantum advantage, and BQP separation claims until a larger audited route closes

## Requirement Results

- P1 [PASS]: Row replay-validation manifest gate remains valid and blocked only on P6/P7/P8
- P2 [PASS]: Priority full-covariance packet remains fixed and source-shaped
- P3 [PASS]: Acceptance packet carries locked full-covariance row schema and evidence classes
- P4 [PASS]: Four-row scope and denominator negative boundary remain preserved
- P5 [PASS]: Current state has no accepted full-covariance rows or B10 credit
- P6 [FAIL]: Full-covariance row acceptance packet has been submitted
- P7 [FAIL]: Submitted acceptance packet satisfies the locked full-covariance row schema
- P8 [FAIL]: Submitted acceptance packet is source-backed, manifest-bound, row-valid, B3-boundary-bound, B10-boundary-bound, and claim-boundary-bound
- P9 [PASS]: Forbidden reopen, solution, advantage, and BQP claims remain false

## Claim Boundary

- Supported: The B3/B10 full-covariance reopen route now has an acceptance packet gate after row replay-validation and before any full compiled-state covariance row, B3 reopen, or B10 credit can count.
- Not supported: No acceptance packet or full-covariance row has been submitted or accepted; B3 remains demoted and no reaction-dynamics solution, positive same-access route, quantum advantage, or BQP separation is supported.
- Next gate: Submit B3-R1-full-covariance-row-acceptance-packet with row scope, full covariance row table, compiled-state replay, covariance replay, derivative estimator replay, denominator replay, optimizer-loop cost ledger, same-access decision, B10 access boundary, row acceptance ledger, B3 reopen boundary, and claim boundary.
