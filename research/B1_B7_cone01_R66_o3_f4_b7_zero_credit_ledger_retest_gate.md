# B1/B7 Cone01 R66 O3-F4 B7 Zero-Credit Ledger Retest Gate

- Target: `T-B1-004fp/T-B7-014y`
- Upstream target: `T-B1-004fo/T-B7-014x`
- Method: `b1_b7_cone01_r66_o3_f4_b7_zero_credit_ledger_retest_gate_v0`
- Status: `cone01_r66_b7_zero_credit_ledger_retest_boundary_passed`
- R66 retest packet hash: `a896579334098a59b4e9ee78245c09edd0fc5f653cbedeeba8128b9358b7d634`

## Result

R66 passes 8/8 requirements by binding the R65 machine-checked row set into a B7 ledger retest boundary while preserving zero admissible ledger credit. The retest is complete as a boundary, not as a promotion.

## Evidence

- Retest rows: `8`
- Machine-checked rows: `8`
- Ledger-credit-admissible rows: `0`
- Accepted exit routes: `0`
- Accepted occurrence removal: `0`
- Accepted proxy-T reduction: `0`
- Logical-T count delta: `0`
- Logical-T depth delta: `0`
- Space-time-volume delta: `0`
- B7 dependency/resource/FT credit allowed: `False` / `False` / `False`
- B7 credit delta: `0`

## Requirement Results

- `Z1` PASS: R65 upstream completed C7 with zero B7 credit
- `Z2` PASS: B7 resource boundary still denies resource, dependency, FT, and STV credit
- `Z3` PASS: R4 refreshed B7 ledger replay remains blocked before accepted exit routes
- `Z4` PASS: All 8 R65 rows are machine checked but none are ledger-credit admissible
- `Z5` PASS: Retest rows carry zero occurrence, proxy-T, logical-T, depth, and STV deltas
- `Z6` PASS: R66 preserves O3, reroute, and B7 zero-credit boundaries
- `Z7` PASS: R66 binds the FT ledger as read-only evidence rather than mutating it
- `Z8` PASS: R66 writes an auditable retest packet and per-row retest files

## Claim Boundary

- Supported: R66 binds the R65 machine-checked row set into a B7 ledger retest boundary and proves the current row set admits zero dependency, resource, FT, STV, occurrence-removal, proxy-T, or ledger credit.
- Not supported: R66 does not close O3, prove a full-circuit rewrite, allow reroute, or grant any B7 ledger promotion.
- Next gate: Submit an accepted exit route or full-circuit rewrite with nonzero occurrence/proxy-T delta before any nonzero B7 ledger retest.

## Remaining Open Obligations

- `accepted_exit_route_or_full_circuit_rewrite_artifact`
- `nonzero_occurrence_or_proxy_t_delta`
- `B7_ledger_retest_after_nonzero_delta`

- validation_error_count: `0`
